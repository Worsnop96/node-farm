# node-farm
it's a little project about a little farm (practice project). Enjoy :)
inside of a folder "dev-data" there is a jason file wich has all the information of the website. 
The template folder contains the template of the views of my app.
The node-farm.js contains all the routes and the pull of information request to the json file.
